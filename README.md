# Cash-Flow-Minimizer
This project aims to optimize financial transactions within a group, reducing the total amount of money that needs to be moved to settle debts or expenses. This is typically achieved by finding the most efficient way for individuals to settle their obligations, minimizing the number of transactions and the overall cash flow required. Essentially, it streamlines the process of splitting expenses or settling debts by ensuring that money flows directly from those who owe to those who are owed, minimizing the number of individual payments. 
Here's a more detailed breakdown:
